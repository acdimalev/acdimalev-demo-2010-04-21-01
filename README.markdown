You must have Cairo and SDL installed to build this demo.

* http://cairographics.org
* http://www.libsdl.org

This demo was developed on a Debian Lenny system with the following dev packages installed:

* libcairo2-dev=1.6.4-7
* libsdl1.2-dev=1.2.13-2

To build and execute the demo, run "make" and then "./foo".

    $ make
    $ ./foo

The demo will pop up in a window.  You can then use the following controls to manipulate the triangle:

* LEFT &mdash; turn left
* RIGHT &mdash; turn right
* UP &mdash; forward
* Q &mdash; quit
